# Customer-Attrition

Customer churn is a very important process in any firm. And the importance of Data Science here is never overstated.
The cost of customer retention is much higher than customer acquisition
To achieve this, its important to analyze the customer behaviour and run predictive analysis on these elements
Here, we are using a dataset having columns Row number, Customer ID, Surname, Credit score, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, No of products, Has credit card, Active member, Estimated salary, Exited with 1000 entries.
To make this dataset a little more interesting, I took some values from certain columns so that the dataset would contain some missing values


We can analyze the correlation matrix for gaining more knowledge about the dadaset
We can understand from the below plots-
This dataset has more customers from France as compared to Germany and Spain
More than 50% of the customers are credit card users
Very few customers have applied for more than 2 products
50% of the customers are active members

An interesting note is that, the performance of the ANN model is better on this dataset (with some missing values) and then handling the missing values rather than when performed on the same dataset without any missing values ie. original dataset.
Such real life ML models can be created to analyze real life dataset and help in creating strategies to reduce the customers attrition in bank/firm,etc and dissatisfaction . Insights from customer feedback and their needs/grievances would also help a lot to find preventive measures for customer retention.
